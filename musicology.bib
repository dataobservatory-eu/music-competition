abstract = {YouTube represents one of the largest scale and most sophisticated industrial recommendation systems in existence. In this paper, we describe the system at a high level and focus on the dramatic performance improvements brought by deep learning. The paper is split according to the classic two-stage information retrieval dichotomy: first, we detail a deep candidate generation model and then describe a separate deep ranking model. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from designing, iterating and maintaining a massive recommendation system with enormous user-facing impact.},

abstract = {An increasing amount of digital music is being published daily. Music streaming services often ingest all available music, but this poses a challenge: how to recommend new artists for which prior knowledge is scarce? In this work we aim to address this so-called cold-start problem by combining text and audio information with user feedback data using deep network architectures. Our method is divided into three steps. First, artist embeddings are learned from biographies by combining semantics, text features, and aggregated usage data. Second, track embeddings are learned from the audio signal and available feedback data. Finally, artist and track embeddings are combined in a multimodal network. Results suggest that both splitting the recommendation problem between feature levels (i.e., artist metadata and audio track), and merging feature embeddings in a multimodal approach improve the accuracy of the recommendations.},
